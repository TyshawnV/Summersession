# Executive Summary
Networking or the process of communication of data. Has become the center of the expasion of human growth, it has aided, people to communicate on a global scale more than ever. With the internet taking a huge expasion in our lives, it has made people from Japan and Africa our neighbors by the click of a button.   

# LucidChart

Created a new blank diagram (ignore message boxes to upgrade) and create a flowchart for a computer program that
asks for a number an
* prints "Big" if the number is greater than 10
* prints "Small" if the number is less than 10

Download your chart as a jpg file and name it: DecisionFlowchart and upload the file to your GitHub lab folder

My experience with Luicidchart was complicatedly great. It was at first not easy to understand, but constantly poking with chart flow, I figured out the format that was asked of by you. Luicidchart is a great website to build a project of flow chart diagrams. The different subscriptions that lucidchart offers looks very interesting to build various diagrams.  

# Networking
## Intro to Networking
Data Transmission

Match the following words with their definitions 

Words:
Packet:
* is a networking packet formatted unit of data by a packet switch network, the packet consists of user information and control information.
Packet-Switching:
* method of grouping data transmitted over a digital network to packets or blocks of data.
IP Address:
* a unqiue string of numbers seperated by a period and number that is represented by a computer to communicate over the internet. 
DNS:
* Domain Name System is a structural naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network.
Protocol:
* established a set rules that determine how data is transmitted between different devices in the same network. 


## Network Hardware
* The benefit of a switch over a hub is a network device connected to the switch is associated with a MAC address to regulate the flow of traffic.  
* The benefit of a router over hubs and switches is your network device is associated by IP address for the network device to communicate over the internet.

## Network Topology
* Explain: A Single point of failure topology, is one router and multiple device is connected to the router, but if some system router stops working the whole system stops working. 
* Infrastructure Topology or AP Topology is an extended wired LAN used to connect to wireless capable devices. A Wireless Mesh is made up of radio nodes organized mesh topology or interconnection amoung device nodes. I would have to say the best topology is a Wireless Mesh Topology, the reason I say this is the best topology for interconnection with devices, if any issue happens to another device it has redundancy.

# Cybersecurity and Encryption

* Imagine you are part of the Amazon.com online chat. Explain how each component of the security triad would impact your job
* Identify three daily tasks that require authentication. Explain how each one could be converted to multi-factor authentication
* Explain ACL and RBAC. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each?
* Explain the interaction of ciphertext, a public key and a private key
* Explain why we need public key cryptography.

## Cryptography
* Type a message in the "Caesar Cipher Exploration box and turn the wheel to encrypt your message.
Then explain the encryption here:

* Type a message in the "Frequency Fingerprint Exploration" box and a) Explain the result.
b) Would it be different for different languages?

* What is a "Polyalphabetic cipher?"
Type a message in the "Polyalphabetic Exploration" box as well as a shift word.
Explain the result.

## Brute Force
* What is Brute-Force and how does it relate to Kerckhoffs's principle?
