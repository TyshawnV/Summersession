# Executive Summary
For Unit 6, I'll be discusiing Internet Protocols, we will dive into the operation and the behind the scenes of the internt. I'll explain the programming, TCP/IP, and the Security that makes purchasing products online safe an easy to understand. I know you may have wondered how does your personal information travel throughout the internet without millions of people knowing your information? In lab 6, I'll do my best to give you a detailed answer of how that occurs. 

# Internet Architecture

## Internet Protocol
* An IP address, is an Internet Protocol address, and it is s an identifying number that is associated with your computer or computer network. IP address can be assoiciated with an IPv4 and IPv6. The difference between the two is IPv4 or Internet Protocol Version 4 is a widely used protocol in data communication over several kinds of networks, and it is associated with network devices to provide logical connections between network devices, which includes providing identification for every device. Then there is new kid on the block IPv6. IPv6 or Internet Protocol Version 6 is the newest version of Internet Protocol used for carrying data in packets from one source to a destination via various networks. IPv6 is considered as an enhanced version of the older IPv4 protocol, as it supports a significantly larger number of nodes than the latter.  
* The IP address of my computer 192.168.1.248
* ICANN It is a not-for-profit partnership of people from all over the world dedicated to keeping the Internet secure, stable and interoperable. It promotes competition and develops policy on the Internet's unique identifiers. 

## TCP/IP

#### Review the first article and answer these questions:
* The responsibility of TCP/IP is an an important internet protocol that is responsible for the transmission or transfer of data packets over networks and across the internet.
* The client-server model applies to TCP/IP, is a relationship in which one program, the client requests a service, or a resource from another program the server. 

#### Review the second article and answer these questions:
Review the section of the article aligning the post office with protocol stacks.  
* Layers are important to changing technology for different functions. Layers are used in digital image editing to separate different elements of an image.  
* The types of applications that run on the "application" layer are FTP, Telnet, NFS, and SMTP.

# Internet Security
#### Watch the video and answer these questions:
* HTTP gives the client a way to interact with web resources such as HTML files by transmitting hypertext messages between clients and servers. HTTP helps support the client-server model act as translator and security for both.
* The protocols that secure HTTP uses to protect data is an encryption protocol such as Transport Layer Security (TLS), or formerly known as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). TLS protocol aims to provide privacy and data integrity between two or more communicating computer applications.

#### Review the following article: Securing Your Web Browser 
* The reason you should secure your browser is you'll be at risk to security breach. A variety of computer problems can caused by from spyware and malware being installed without your knowledge to intruders taking control of your computer. 
 
# Internet Programming

* Upload screenshots of your html, css and result

# Conclusion
A ton of things are happening in the backgroud of your computer, so you can buy that new bookbag or book you have been looking at on Amazon. Data is being processed now to look at this Github repo. The moving parts behind the application never really recieve the recognition, but you can believe without the security and the communication of the client-server none of this would be possible.
