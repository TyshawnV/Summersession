# Executive Summary
Networking or the process of communication of data. Has become the center of the expasion of human growth, it has aided, people to communicate on a global scale more than ever. With the internet taking a huge expasion in our lives, it has made people from Japan and Africa our neighbors by the click of a button.   

# LucidChart

Created a new blank diagram (ignore message boxes to upgrade) and create a flowchart for a computer program that
asks for a number an
* prints "Big" if the number is greater than 10
* prints "Small" if the number is less than 10

Download your chart as a jpg file and name it: DecisionFlowchart and upload the file to your GitHub lab folder

My experience with Luicidchart was complicatedly great. It was at first not easy to understand, but constantly poking with chart flow, I figured out the format that was asked of by you. Luicidchart is a great website to build a project of flow chart diagrams. The different subscriptions that lucidchart offers looks very interesting to build various diagrams.  

# Networking
## Intro to Networking
Data Transmission

Match the following words with their definitions 

Words:
Packet:
* is a networking packet formatted unit of data by a packet switch network, the packet consists of user information and control information.
Packet-Switching:
* method of grouping data transmitted over a digital network to packets or blocks of data.
IP Address:
* a unqiue string of numbers seperated by a period and number that is represented by a computer to communicate over the internet. 
DNS:
* Domain Name System is a structural naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network.
Protocol:
* established a set rules that determine how data is transmitted between different devices in the same network. 


## Network Hardware
* The benefit of a switch over a hub is a network device connected to the switch is associated with a MAC address to regulate the flow of traffic.  
* The benefit of a router over hubs and switches is your network device is associated by IP address for the network device to communicate over the internet.

## Network Topology
* Explain: A Single point of failure topology, is one router and multiple device is connected to the router, but if some system router stops working the whole system stops working. 
* Infrastructure Topology or AP Topology is an extended wired LAN used to connect to wireless capable devices. A Wireless Mesh is made up of radio nodes organized mesh topology or interconnection amoung device nodes. I would have to say the best topology is a Wireless Mesh Topology, the reason I say this is the best topology for interconnection with devices, if any issue happens to another device it has redundancy.

# Cybersecurity and Encryption

* In the security triad you have confidentiality, integrity, and availability all three are an essential part in a well run company. Confidentiality is used to protect users information against unauthorized disclosure of their information. Integrity gives the user protection over unauthorized modifications like add, delete, or change of data. Availabiltiy is protecting the functionality of support systems and ensuring data is fully available at the point in time  or period requirements by its users. All of these factor into a well oiled business machine 
* Three daily tasks that require authentication is password, smart card, and fingerprint. Multi-factor authentication can be applied in the daily authentication. Passwords in MFA, can be setup verification code or choose the picture with the car to authentication. Smart card authentication method is via pin a series a number. Fingerprint MFA is a biometric way of authentication via finger print DNA.   
* An ACL is a list of permissions attached to an object, it specifies which user and processes are granted access and RBAC (Roll Bases Access Control) defining a list and adding each user in the system to one and more roles. The disadvantages of ACL is you can only assign them to a single user and RBAC is more collective group of permissions. 
* The interaction of ciphertext, is an encryption of plain text using algorithim like a public key that is only used encrypt data and to decrypt the data, and a private key is used to both encrypt and decrypt the data and is shared between the sender and receiver of encrypted data.* Explain why we need public key cryptography.

## Cryptography
* Type a message in the "Caesar Cipher Exploration box and turn the wheel to encrypt your message.
Then explain the encryption here: I wrote "Juiceman got the trap jumping" Output was "fqeyaiwj ckp pda pda pnwl fqilejc"

* Type a message in the "Frequency Fingerprint Exploration" box and a) Explain the result.
b) Would it be different for different languages?

* What is a "Polyalphabetic cipher?"
Type a message in the "Polyalphabetic Exploration" box as well as a shift word.
Explain the result.

## Brute Force
* Brute-Force is the action of of force through applications though constant attacks to the user device, it relates to Kerckhoffs's principle that states that the security of a cryptosystem must lie in the choice of its keys only

# Conclusion
Networking and Security is the core foundation of a well oil business machine. You have to be ale to communicate to people and what a better way than via internet. Where people from all walks of life share information, and personal data over the web, it makes everyone neighbors by the click of a button. You have to have security as well and if you're going to share personal data, it has to be encrypted, as you would'nt want valuable information leaked out.
